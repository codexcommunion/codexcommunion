CodexCommunion is a humble effort to gather, preserve, and share knowledge as an act of service and communion. Just as the faithful are called to share in the Communion of Saints, we seek to make the gifts of learning, creativity, and wisdom more accessible to all.

Inspired by St. Isidore of Seville, who labored to compile and order knowledge for the benefit of others, we continue this work in the digital age--not for our own sake, but so that what is good, true, and beautiful may be freely given, as it has been freely received.

May this work be offered for the glory of God and the good of others, that knowledge may be used rightly and shared generously.
